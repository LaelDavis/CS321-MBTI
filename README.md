# MBTI

This is a repo for a dating application that focuses on the Myers Briggs Test Indicator, more formally known as MBTI. It will be inspired by Tinder and various dating applications.

Setup:

I would highly recommend running this in something like Visual Studio Code, as it was pretty seamless for me in my experience.

You will need to have some installations installed before running the application:
	- Yarn
	- NodeJS

These two are mainly for hosting the server while you upload and work on the application. You can view your changes as you refresh the browser or application in real time.

Steps:

For the steps, you would need to work your way into the "mbti" directory and once inside just call "yarn" to build/update the application. Afterwards, just call "yarn run start" to start the application.

If there is anything you need or any questions, just ping me at ldavis24@masonlive.gmu.edu.
